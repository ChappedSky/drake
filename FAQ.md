# How is Drake different than my favorite tool, X?

We may not know X, but if you're using it we bet it's a great tool! What we
can share with you is that we put a lot of thought and work into building
features in Drake that are specialized for today's modern data workflow
processing problems. In our experience these features are generally hard
to achieve, or downright lacking, in many popular tools:

* multiple outputs
* no-input and no-output steps
* HDFS support
* forced execution of any subbranch, up or down the tree or any individual targets (crucial for debugging and development)
* target exclusions
* protocol abstraction - e.g., inline Python, R, Ruby, Clojure
* tags
* branching
* methods

Please see [the full Drake specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bF-OKNLIG10v_lMes_m4yyaJtAaJKtdK0Jizvi_MNsg/edit) for a better understanding of the
feature's we've chosen to focus on.

All that said, if you've found a tool that is more ideal for your purposes,
far be it from us to try to make you use Drake. Keep on rockin'!

# How is Drake different than Make?

Drake is targeted squarely at the problem of data workflow management,
as opposed to software project build management. Drake has specific features
related to today's data processing challenges that you won't find in Make:

* HDFS support
* Easy handling of multiple outputs from a single step
* Mulitple language support inline, e.g. Ruby, Python, Clojure
* Integration with common data analysis tools, e.g. R

Of course, if you find Make to be the best solution for your problem, that's
great! As always, YMMV.

# How is Drake different than BPipe?

From what we know of BPipe, it's great! One major philosophical difference
seems to be that BPipe figures out how to resolve your dependency graph as
it goes. Drake, on the other hand, prefers to resolve your dependency
graph up front.

TODO: elaborate

If you find BPipe to be the best solution for your problem, that's
great! As always, YMMV.

# Why do I get an `ERROR java.io.IOException` when I try using Drake with HDFS?

It could be that your build of Drake is not using a Hadoop client library that
is compatible with your cluster. Please see [the wiki entry on HDFS compatibility](https://github.com/Factual/drake/wiki/HDFS-Compatibility).

# Why doesn't Drake recognize I have up-to-date output in HDFS?

Drake looks for Hadoop configuration in `/etc/hadoop/conf/core-site.xml`. It
may be that in your environment, you keep your Hadoop configuration elsewhere.
Try copying or symlinking your Hadoop configuration to `/etc/hadoop/conf/core-site.xml`.

# Why is Drake written in Clojure?

We love Clojure at Factual. Lisp is an extremely powerful language, and
Clojure brings all this to the practical JVM world. And Lisp is quite good
in operating on lists and graphs, which is a big part of Drake.

Clojure has a very good syntax for Java interop, so all Java libraries are
available to us. But, of course, Clojure community also spits out libraries
like crazy, for example, take a look at [fnparse](https://github.com/joshua-choi/fnparse),
which we use in Drake for parsing.
